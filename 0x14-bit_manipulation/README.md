# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate various bit manipulation tasks. These tasks involve working with binary representation, bitwise operations, and endianness.

## Task 0
Implement a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

### Prototype
```c
unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
